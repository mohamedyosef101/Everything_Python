# **Lists**

## **Length**

We can count the number of entries in any list with `len()`, which is short for "length". You need only supply the name of the list in the parentheses.

```python
*# The list has ten entries*
print(len(flowers_list))
```

> 10
> 

## **Indexing**

We can refer to any item in the list according to its position in the list (first, second, third, etc). This is called **indexing**.

Note that Python uses zero-based indexing, which means that:

- to pull the first entry in the list, you use 0,
- to pull the second entry in the list, you use 1, and
- to pull the final entry in the list, you use one less than the length of the list.

```python
print("First entry:", flowers_list[0])
print("Second entry:", flowers_list[1])

*# The list has length ten, so we refer to final entry with 9*
print("Last entry:", flowers_list[9])
```

> First entry: pink primrose
Second entry: hard-leaved pocket orchid
Last entry: globe thistle
> 

**Side Note**: You may have noticed that in the code cell above, we use a single `print()` to print multiple items (both a Python string (like `"First entry:"`) and a value from the list (like `flowers_list[0]`). To print multiple things in Python with a single command, we need only separate them with a comma.

## **Slicing**

You can also pull a segment of a list (for instance, the first three entries or the last two entries). This is called **slicing**. For instance:

- to pull the first `x` entries, you use `[:x]`, and
- to pull the last `y` entries, you use `[-y:]`.

```python
print("First three entries:", flowers_list[:3])
print("Final two entries:", flowers_list[-2:])
```

> First three entries: ['pink primrose', 'hard-leaved pocket orchid', 'canterbury bells']
Final two entries: ['monkshood', 'globe thistle']
> 

As you can see above, when we slice a list, it returns a new, shortened list.

## **Removing items**

```python
flowers_list.remove("globe thistle")
print(flowers_list)
```

> *['pink primrose', 'hard-leaved pocket orchid', 'canterbury bells', 'sweet pea', 'english marigold', 'tiger lily', 'moon orchid', 'bird of paradise', 'monkshood']*
> 

## **Adding items**

Add an item to a list with `.append()`, and put the item you would like to add in parentheses.

```python
flowers_list.append("snapdragon")
print(flowers_list)
```

> *['pink primrose', 'hard-leaved pocket orchid', 'canterbury bells', 'sweet pea', 'english marigold', 'tiger lily', 'moon orchid', 'bird of paradise', 'monkshood', 'snapdragon']*
> 

## **Lists are not just for strings**

```python
hardcover_sales = [139, 128, 172, 139, 191, 168, 170]
```

Here, `hardcover_sales` is a list of integers. Similar to when working with strings, you can still do things like get the length, pull individual entries, and extend the list.
