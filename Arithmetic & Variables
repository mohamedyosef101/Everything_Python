# Printing

One of the simplest (and most important!) tasks you can ask a computer to do is to print a message.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

> Hello, world!
> 

# **Arithmetic**

We can also print the value of some arithmetic operation (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

```python
print(1 + 2)
```

> 3
> 

More examples...

| Operation | Symbol | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Addition | + | 1 + 2 = 3 |
| Subtraction | - | 5 - 4 = 1 |
| Multiplication | * | 2 * 4 = 8 |
| Division | / | 6 / 3 = 2 |
| Exponent | ** | 3 ** 2 = 9 |

You can control the order of operations in long calculations with parentheses.

```python
print(((1 + 3) * (9 - 2) / 2) ** 2)
```

# **Comments**

To indicate to Python that a line is comment (and not Python code), you need to write a pound sign (`#`) as the very first character.

```python
*# Multiply 3 by 2*
print(3 * 2)
```

> 6

# **Creating variables**

```python
*# Create a variable called test_var and give it a value of 4+5*
test_var = 4 + 5

*# Print the value of test_var*
print(test_var)
```

> 9

# Naming Rules

- They can't have spaces (e.g., `test var` is not allowed)
- They can only include letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g., `test_var!` is not allowed)
- They have to start with a letter or underscore (e.g., `1_var` is not allowed)
