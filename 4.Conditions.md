# **Conditions**

```python
print(2 > 3)
```

> False
> 

*Python identifies this as False, since 2 is not greater than 3.*

List of common symbols…

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| == | equals |
| != | does not equal |
| < | less than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater than or equal to |

# **Conditional statements**

**Conditional statements** use conditions to modify how your function runs. They check the value of a condition, and if the condition evaluates to `True`, then a certain block of code is executed. (Otherwise, if the condition is `False`, then the code is not run.)

You will see several examples of this in the following sections.

## **"if" statements**

```python
def evaluate_temp(temp):
    *# Set an initial message*
		message = "Normal temperature."
    *# Update value of message only if temperature greater than 38*
		if temp > 38:
        message = "Fever!"
    return message
```

## **"if ... else" statements**

```python
def evaluate_temp_with_else(temp):
    if temp > 38:
        message = "Fever!"
    else:
        message = "Normal temperature."
    return message
```

## **"if ... elif ... else" statements**

```python
def evaluate_temp_with_elif(temp):
    if temp > 38:
        message = "Fever!"
    elif temp > 35:
        message = "Normal temperature."
    else:
        message = "Low temperature."
    return message
```

# **Example - Calculations**

In this next example, say you live in a country with only two tax brackets. Everyone earning less than 12,000 pays 25% in taxes, and anyone earning 12,000 or more pays 30%. The function below calculates how much tax is owed.

```python
def get_taxes(earnings):
    if earnings < 12000:
        tax_owed = .25 * earningselse:
        tax_owed = .30 * earningsreturn tax_owed
```

The next code cell uses the function.

```python
ana_taxes = get_taxes(9000)
bob_taxes = get_taxes(15000)

print(ana_taxes)
print(bob_taxes)
```

> 2250.0
4500.0
